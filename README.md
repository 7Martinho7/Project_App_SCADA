# Project_App_SCADA

My project is about replacing an old supervisor. This supervisor manage real-time data from an OPC server. My job is to code a new supervisor that fit the attempt of the peaple who work with it. I want to code it in C# because of the windows form that make it easy to build a GUI. 

Technical information :
- Server OPC DA installed on a computer from Applicom Card
- I've access to that computer and can run my application on it
